#### Doki Doki Literature Club web port
June 1 2023

Works for me in Chrome but not Firefox for some reason, not sure why.

First things first, if this is your first time hearing about DDLC definitely play DDLC from a regular install from [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe/) or Steam if possible, as the experience will likely be much better than in this browser port. This game is seriously amazing, and I highly recommend playing it.

DDLC was honestly pretty easy to port to Web/HTML5 since in the more recent Ren'Py (game engine used by DDLC) versions, web ports are supported in Ren'Py's launcher. It surprises me that I couldn't find anyone else that already did this. One nice thing about this web port is that it also allows you to play the game on mobile without having to download anything, which is part of the reason why I made this. Also, this port of DDLC was created from Ren'Py version 8.1.0 using [this port](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/DokiDoki-RenPy) from SecondThundeR. 

Also not sure if this is TOS, but I don't think anyone really cares that much anymore. By all means though, if anyone anyone at Team Salvato wants me to take this down, feel free to let me know and it will be done.

## TODO: 
- forgot to add mod disclaimer, so I guess I'll just add it here for now: 

This is a Doki Doki Literature Club fan game that is not affiliated with Team Salvato. It is designed to be played only after the official game has been completed. You can download Doki Doki Literature Club at: http://ddlc.moe
